A lot actually, like running into an infinite loop when I tried to reveal
all adjacent blanc blocks at the same time

like have to deal with the situation where the first block the user clicked on is a 
bomb

I am an exchange from China, and I actually majored in English,
strange Ichose the course. Probably because I probably want to learn something
wo made my recruiting or master application easier, I know, snobish Chinese?
But I do think programming is something awarding, when you see your code working,
step by step, that sense of achievement is marvelous. I will go back to CHina soon
and I thought I really had a happy and fulfilling semester here.
Among all TAs, I want to give extra credit to Alan, he's god, give that guy a bonus!!!
